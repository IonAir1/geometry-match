It is recommended that you play this on a mobile/touchscreen device. Though mouse control can be used for extra difficulty. The game has been tested on android devices, simply open this website on your phone. The theme was "collect" and here, you collect shapes and match them to the correct hole. Feedback is very much appreciated!



Mismatching objects will cause you to lose health. Correctly matching the objects with a green cross will heal you to full health. Correctly Matching White objects will cause your game to mommentarily freeze
